# Du shuzhi xing 读书之星

Small school kids if they read bravely can be awarded the title of a reading star. The award is beautiful bright red button with a girl holding two books in her hand (is she reading? evaluating? or considering which book to throw at her younger brother first?)! Inscribed on it is 读书之星 in Chinese characters and in pinyin: *Du shuzhi xing*. So, whoever printed that definetely is NOT a reading (or studying) star!!
